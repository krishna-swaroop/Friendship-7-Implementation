# Friendship-7-Implementation

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Friendship-7 satellite orbit.
Given the required orbital elements, the script will output the current position of the satellite in terms of latitude and longitude.

This was done as part of an Assignment in the Satellite Communications course in 6th Semester at BITS Pilani.
